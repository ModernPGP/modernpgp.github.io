This initiative came out of a hackday at EFF headquarters in July, 2014 following the SOUPS conference. The idea was to have an open working group that improves the usability of PGP amongst end users and developers. Further growth and the future of this iniative was solidified at the OpenPGP / GnuPG Summit in April, 2015 by an even larger group of PGP project creators.

If you work on PGP related software or know of a project under active development and would like it be included on this site please send a pull request to [our github repo](https://github.com/ModernPGP/modernpgp.github.io) or open an issue on the repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ModernPGP/modernpgp.github.io/issues). Thanks.

Currently this site is being mantained by me [Brennan Novak](https://brennannovak.com), but I'd like it to be more of a community effort. I'd love *your* help and contributions.
