# 1st OpenPGP Summit April 18 - 19, 2015

A group of creators from numerous OpenPGP related projects met in Dreieich near Frankfurt, Germany
and formed a working group to push forward the state of PGP.

The first day we introduced each other and presented the various [projects](#projects-and-people).
The second day, we split up and discussed some [topics](#topics) in smaller groups.
One topic was about [how to continue in future](./future.md).
